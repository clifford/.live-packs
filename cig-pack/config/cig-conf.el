;; The REPL buffer name can also display the port on which the nREPL server is running. Buffer name will look like cider-repl project-name:port.
(setq nrepl-buffer-name-show-port t)

;; Make C-c C-z switch to the CIDER REPL buffer in the current window:
(setq cider-repl-display-in-current-window t)

;;The use of paredit when editing Clojure (or any other Lisp) code is highly recommended. You're probably using it already in your clojure-mode buffers (if you're not you probably should). You might also want to enable paredit in the REPL buffer as well:
(add-hook 'cider-repl-mode-hook 'paredit-mode)

;;smartparens is an excellent alternative to paredit. Many Clojure hackers have adopted it recently and you might want to give it a try as well. To enable smartparens in the REPL buffer use the following code:
;;(add-hook 'cider-repl-mode-hook 'smartparens-strict-mode)
